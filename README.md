## McDowell's Burgers and Caf√©

### üíª Description:
McDowell‚Äôs is a fullstack application developed with Next.js and TypeScript, designed to function as a kiosk system for a fast-food and caf√© business.

* The customer-facing side runs under /order/[category], where users can select items, place an order, and complete payment seamlessly.

* The kitchen/admin panel is located at /admin, where staff can:
-- View incoming orders in real-time
-- Update order statuses (e.g., mark as completed)
-- Manage the menu by creating and editing products

* Once an order is completed, it is displayed at /orders, serving as the pickup screen where customers can confirm their orders are ready.

The app is powered by MongoDB with Prisma for database management, and uses SWR, Zod, and Zustand for state management, data fetching, and schema validation. Together, these tools ensure a responsive, scalable, and reliable kiosk experience tailored for the food-service industry.

Feel free to create your own orders!
